# **Learning Markdown**

### **What is it?**

Markdown is a syntax for coding that is compatible with many different applications and text editors. It keeps things simple and easy to operate while allowing you to do much more with your file than if you were just typing in notepad.

### **How do we use it?**

There are many different operators that can be used to change the format of your text.  
Some of the easiest things to do are:

- *italicizing* font with *
- **bolding** font by using **
- create headings with # using more # for a smaller header and less # for a larger one
- create a list using - or 1. if you want a numbered list

Some more advanced things that can be done are adding images and links.
An image is added using `![Image Text](Image filepath or URL)`. You need to be more careful when adding an image because the syntax is more complicated and proper sizing can be tough to manage without using HTML commands.  
The easiest way to add a [link](https://mattlarkin8.github.io/reading-notes/Markdown.html) is by using <> to encapsulate a URL or email address. It can be more complicated when you want to do something more advanced like adding titles to your [link](https://mattlarkin8.github.io/reading-notes/Markdown.html "Example Title"). This requires you to use the full format `[Link name or text](Link URL "Title")`.

### **What have we learned?**

Markdown is pretty easy to get into because of it's simplicity. It lets a beginner start to play around and format things how they want right away. However, it has more advanced commands and will only become a more powerful tool the longer you use it. With some practice, the user is going to be able to put together great looking webpages by simply using the full potential of Markdown.
