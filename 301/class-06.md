# **NODE.JS**

## **Introduction to Node.js**

### What is node.js?

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

It is the JavaScript engine that runs in Chrome web browsers. It is what compiles and runs the JavaScript code in your browser. Also, the V8 engine is open-source.

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

It means that it is a program that can provide the same (or better) functionality as a web browser for compiling and running JavaScript code. This gives us the ability to run and test code running locally on our machine without the need for an actual web browser.

### What is npm?

It is the package manager that comes bundled with node.js and also the worlds largest software registry.

### What version of node are you running on your machine?

v18.0.0

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

8.6.0

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

npm install -g jshint

### What is node used for?

Node.js (and npm) are used for installing and running build tools. You can use them to run tests, bundle files, and automate linting and style checking.

## **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning form fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

I think Greater Efficiency became a really apparent benefit to me during our 201 project week. Coding in pairs to accomplish things seemed like it really helped us produce good results quickly. I personally had a really good time with the pair programming that I was a part of and found that we benefited from many of the things mentioned in the reading. We were able to talk out problems and work together to come to a solution fairly quickly. If we got stuck on something, one of us could find an answer online and get us back on track. I can absolutely see how it is a bit slower to complete the product, but you end up delivering something of much higher quality that takes less time to fix. I also agree that it made programming more enjoyable, which is obviously a huge plus.

### How does pair programming work?

Pair programming typically works by having a Driver, who is actually typing the code, and a Navigator, who does not write any code but directs the workflow of the driver and helps find solutions to any problems.

## **Things I want to know more about**

I want to learn more about node.js and the different tools it provides. We have been using it to support the work we do in class, but I don't actually know too much about what we are using it for or the other things I could be using it for.
