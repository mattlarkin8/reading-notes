# **Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry**

## **That Time When Women Stopped Coding**

### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

Personal computers started to become common household items.

### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

They already had experience with computers and this led to a change in expectations for requisite knowledge in college programs.

## **Why diversity matters to your tech company**

### When are diversity efforts most successful?

They are most successful when driven by a commitment from company leaders.

### Why do diverse companies perform better?

They perform better because diverse teams are smarter and more creative. With a wider variety of opinions, there are more ideas to pull from and it is easier to find success.

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

A company that is more diverse will likely be more representative of its customer base. When the employees better represent the customers, it is easier for them to create products that appeal to the customers because it also appeals to them.

## **Things I want to know more about**

I am interested in how much effort companies put into having employees that are representative of their customers. I think it totally makes sense to have people that can relate to the users work on that product. Since people are naturally going to create something that they like or would use, then the creators are also the first customers.
