## **Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack**

### What is a ‘call’?

A call refers to a function call, which means a function that has been invoked. As many functions are invoked and need to be processed they form the call stack.

### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

In synchronous programming, calls are processed one at a time from top to bottom of the stack.

### What does LIFO mean?

Last In, First Out

### What causes a Stack Overflow?

A stack overflow happens when a function calls itself without an exit point. There are a maximum number of calls that the stack can accommodate, after which it overflows.

## **JavaScript error messages**

### What is a ‘reference error’?

A reference error occurs when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared.

### What is a ‘syntax error’?

A syntax error is caused by trying to parse a command that doesn't match the syntax rules.

### What is a ‘range error’?

Range errors are caused by an element that has an invalid length.

### What is a ‘type error’?

Type errors occur when the types of variables you try to use don't match up.

### What is a breakpoint?

A breakpoint is a spot in your code that you can specify for the code to stop running. This is useful to debug your code by being able to check values at certain places or before and after operations.

### What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

Debugger can be used to place a breakpoint in your code so you start debugging it.

## **Things I want to know more about**

I want to get a firm grasp on the call stack and synchronous programming to prepare for learning about asynchronous programs in the future.
