# **Introduction to React and Components**

## **Component-Based Architecture**

### What is a “component”?

A component is a software object that is modular, portable, replaceable, reusable, and interacts with other components to provide a certain functionality.

### What are the characteristics of a component?

Components are:

- Reusable - They are made to be reused in different applications
- Replaceable - They can be swapped with other components easily
- Extensible - They can be built upon to add new behavior
- Encapsulated - They provide functionality without exposing internal processes
- Independent - They have minimal dependency on other components
- Not context specific - They can operate in different environments

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

Components offer many advantages including reduced cost, ease of development and deployment, reusability, reliability, and independence.

## **What is Props and How to Use it in React**

### **What is “props” short for?**

Props is short for properties and is used to pass data between components.

### **How are props used in React?**

In React, props are used to define an attribute and its corresponding data. The usage is very similar to passing arguments into a function in JavaScript. This allows you to have one component produce different results based on the content you passed it using props.

### **What is the flow of props?**

Props data is read-only and they can only be passed from a parent to a child component. This means the child can't alter the data passed to it and props *do not* open some kind of communication channel between components.

## **Things I want to know more about**

I look forward to getting practice using props. The comparison to function parameters/arguments really helped me understand the concept of its use. I feel like once I start using it more, I will really get a good understanding of how it works.
