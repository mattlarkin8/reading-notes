# **Intro to SQL**

## **Relational Databases**

SQL is a form of relational database where information is stored in tables. These tables must have Schema that define what data will be stored and how it is organized. Different tables can be used to store different kinds of data, but these tables can be linked together through data they have in common, which is what makes the it a Relational Database. Using these relationships, we are able to create many different tables that store and organize different data and then access the data from multiple different tables using various querying techniques. With all of the different query methods available, we can search and order data, as well as ADD, DELETE, and UPDATE data in a table and even the tables themselves.
