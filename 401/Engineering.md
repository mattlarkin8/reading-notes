# **Engineering Readings**

## **Why is this important?**

These concepts are all important to understand and practice. Knowing how to value your time and focus on your goals is essential to accomplishing those goals. If your time isn't valuable to you then who is it valuable to? Thinking like a programmer and learning how to properly solve problems starts to tie into this as well. Obviously spending your time solving programming problems is worth your time as a programmer, but how much time do want to spend on it? Understanding how to approach problems and solve them with a good system will not only make you better at solving problems, but also make you faster (or at least more efficient) at solving problems. You should be looking to efficiently produce high quality results from whatever you deem worthy of your time. The Super Mario Effect can also help you to keep a positive attitude throughout the process and keep you motivated to solve the issue. Remember that it is good to keep making forward progress and with enough steps forward, you will eventually reach the finish.

## **Discussion**

### **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

My logical thinking and problem solving ability is something unique to me. I the way I can approach and solve a problem will be beneficial to any employer.

### **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

1. Ask "Why?" or "How?", making sure to fully understand the problem domain.

2. Ensure I have a sound plan, including the manual steps to solve the issue.

3. Take a break and then re-assess the problem.
