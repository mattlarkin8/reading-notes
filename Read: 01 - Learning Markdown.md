# **Learning Markdown**

### **What is it?**
Markdown is a syntax for coding that is compatible with many different applications and text editors. It keeps things simple and easy to operate while allowing you to do much more with your file than if you were just typing in notepad.

### **How do we use it?**
There are many different operators that can be used to change the format of your text.  
Some of the easiest things to do are:
- *italicizing* font with *
- **bolding** font by using **
- create headings with # using more # for a smaller header and less # for a larger one
- creat a list using - or 1. if you want a numbered list

Some more advanced things that can be done are adding images and links.
An image is added using ![Image Text](Image filepath or URL). You need to be more careful when adding an image because the syntax is more complicated and proper sizing can be tough to manage without using HTML commands.  
The easiest way to add a [link] is by putting the URL in <> like <URL>.
