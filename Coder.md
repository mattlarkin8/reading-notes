### **Text Editor Classifications**
Basic text editors like notepad are the most basic option available with little to no extra features. They operate in plain text format with no option for any other formatting or anything fancy. While they work just fine and can be used, they lack a lot of features and extensions that more advanced text editors can provide to make your life much easier.

Advanced text editors like Visual Studio Code or Atom have many different extensions as well as some core features that are very important to your quality of life and ease of use. Two of the biggest features are Code Completion and Syntax Highlighting. Code Completion suggests possible completions to the command you are typing. This saves you time by giving you a shortcut to finish the command while also reducing the risk of mistyping something. Some editors will even automatically close tags and brackets when you open them, which saves more time and also helps you to keep your work organized.

While a text editor does pretty much what the name suggests, an IDE is a whole software suite where a text editor is just a single part of it. An IDE additionally acts as a file manager, compiler, and debugger. While you don't need all of these tools when starting out, they can become quite useful once you move onto more advanced coding. 

There are many different applications that you can use to write your code and while some of them have very helpful features, in the end the best thing to use is what feels good and works for you. If you think it's the best text editor, then it is at the very least the best text editor for you.
