## **Operators**

There are many different operators in JavaScript and they all do something different.

- Comma operator

### **Assignment Operators**

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is `=`, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x. 

If a variable refers to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that variable.
