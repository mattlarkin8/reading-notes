Hello everyone! I am Matthew Larkin and this is my reading notes repository. I'm a US Air Force veteran that has worked in IT for seven years. I am pretty new to coding, but I'm really excited to learn and continue to imrove myself. I look forward to working with everyone as we all work toward our goal.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to work together on something. I'm sure we can both help each other out.
