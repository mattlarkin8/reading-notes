Hello everyone! I am Matthew Larkin and this is my reading notes page. I am a US Air Force veteran that has worked in IT for seven years. I am pretty new to coding, but I'm really excited to learn and continue to imrove myself. I look forward to working with everyone as we all work toward our goal.

### **Growth Mindset**
To me, the growth mindset is all about constant improvement and enabling yourself to pursue it. We are all here to learn and improve and its important to have the right mentality to facilitate that. There may be times where you are facing a tough issue and you just don't feel very motivated anymore. It's important to remember that you aren't going to be great at everything right from the start. It's good to take a break to refocus or ask someone for help if you are stuck on a problem. Maintaining a positive attitude and willingness to work through challenges is the key to learning a tough subject and improving yourself.

### **Reminders to myself**
1. Just because you aren't an expert now doesn't mean you won't be in the future. You're just not there *yet*.
2. As much as you want to learn and do things on your own, your peers and instructors are there to help. If you're stuck on something and need help don't be afraid to ask. There is nothing wrong with needing help and it can be beneficial to both parties to work through your issue.
3. Mistakes are ***good***. It is alright to make mistakes or be wrong; it's actually a very important part of the learning process. Mistakes show that you are putting in effort and trying to solve the problem. It's all about how you can learn and improve from your mistakes.
