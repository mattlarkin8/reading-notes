# **My Reading Notes**

## **About Me**
Hello everyone! I am Matthew Larkin and this is my reading notes page.

### **Growth Mindset**
To me, the growth mindset is all about constant improvement and enabling yourself to pursue it. We are all here to learn and improve and its important to have the right mentality to facilitate that. There may be times where you are facing a tough issue and you just don't feel very motivated anymore. It's important to remember that you aren't going to be great at everything right from the start. It's good to take a break to refocus or ask someone for help if you are stuck on a problem. Maintaining a positive attitude and willingness to work through challenges is the key to learning a tough subject and improving yourself.
