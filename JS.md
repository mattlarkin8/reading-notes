# **Web design using JavaScript**

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted language with first-class functions. It is most commonly known as a language for web pages, but it also has use in some non-browser environments like Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat.

JavaScript uses variables to create interactive functions. There are three main ways to declare a variable:

- `let` is used to define a variable where the value can change
- `const` is used to define a constant variable where you don't expect the value to change
- `var` is old and is really only used in JavaScript that is from 2015 or older

All JavaScript variables must have unique names and these are some general rules for naming them:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
- Names are case sensitive (z and Z are different variables)
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

In JavaScript, the equal sign `=` is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. The "equal to" operator is `==` in JavaScript. JavaScript variables can hold numbers and text values. Text values are called strings and a `"string"` is written in quotes. Numbers are written without quotes, but if you do write a number in quotes it will be stored as a string. You can perform many different arithmetic functions by using operators like `+` `-` `*` `/`.
